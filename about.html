    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p><strong>Global MEDILAW Organisation</strong> is a platform that bridges the gap between healthcare and legal support, especially for underserved communities. Our mission is to deliver holistic aid — combining the compassion of medicine with the power of legal advocacy.</p>

    <p>Our slogan <em>“Healing Hands, Justice Minds”</em> reflects our commitment to health, justice, and sustainability. We aim to uplift individuals and communities by providing free health checkups, legal consultations, awareness programs, and more — especially in rural and tribal regions.</p>

    <p>Founded by passionate individuals in both the medical and legal fields, the organisation also works closely with student volunteers to create lasting social change.</p>

    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> “To provide comprehensive support to individuals, families, communities, and nations, promoting health, justice, and sustainability.”</p>
